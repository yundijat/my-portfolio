excerpt: How working alongside AI tools is changing the way I write, review, and think about code.

At first, I treated AI coding tools like advanced autocomplete.

I would generate snippets, copy them, and move on.

Over time, my workflow changed completely. I stopped seeing AI as a tool and started treating it more like a **development partner** — one that accelerates thinking rather than replacing it.

## AI Changed My Starting Point

Previously, starting a feature meant staring at an empty file.

Now, I begin with exploration:
- generating rough implementations
- comparing approaches quickly
- asking questions about tradeoffs

Instead of removing learning, this actually increased my curiosity. I spend more time understanding *why* something works.

## The Trap of Blind Acceptance

One mistake I made early was trusting generated code too quickly.

AI can produce convincing solutions that:
- miss edge cases
- introduce performance issues
- ignore architectural constraints

Now I treat AI output as a draft, not a final answer.

My rule is simple:
> If I can't explain the code, I don't ship it.

## AI Makes Reviews Faster — and Harder

Code reviews changed in unexpected ways.

AI-generated code is often clean but sometimes lacks context. During reviews, I focus more on:
- clarity of intent
- maintainability
- system impact

Good engineering judgment matters more than ever.

## Learning Feels Different Now

AI shortens the gap between curiosity and experimentation.

When I encounter unfamiliar concepts, I can:
- prototype quickly
- ask follow-up questions
- iterate immediately

This creates a faster feedback loop than traditional learning methods.

## Skills That Became More Valuable

Interestingly, AI increased the importance of human skills:

- problem framing
- architecture decisions
- debugging reasoning
- communication

Writing code is easier. Designing good systems is still hard.

## How I Use AI Today

My workflow now looks like this:

1. Think through the problem manually
2. Use AI to explore approaches
3. Validate and simplify the result
4. Refactor for long-term maintainability

AI speeds up execution, but direction still comes from the developer.

## Final Reflection

AI didn’t make development less creative.

It removed repetitive friction and gave me more space to focus on design, structure, and user experience — the parts of software development I enjoy the most.

The future of building software feels less like coding alone and more like collaborating with intelligent tools.
